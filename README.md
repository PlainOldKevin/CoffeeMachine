# Coffee Machine
A coffee machine where cutomers can order an espresso, a latte, or a capuccino. Payment is done through the use of American coins (penny, nickel, dime, quarter).
Machine restocker can access the resources feature to see which ingredients (water, coffee, or milk) need restocking, through use of a secret 'password' ;)
