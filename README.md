# Coffee Machine
A coffee machine where cutomers can order an espresso, a latte, or a capuccino. Payment is done through the use of American coins (penny, nickel, dime, quarter).

## Machine controls
A list of some controls to operate the machine outside of ordering coffee:

* `off`: Turns the machine off
* `report`: Generates a report of available ingredients (water, coffee, milk) as well as profit from the machine's operation
* `refill`: Refills the ingredients to the maximum amount the machine holds (to make more delicious coffee!)
